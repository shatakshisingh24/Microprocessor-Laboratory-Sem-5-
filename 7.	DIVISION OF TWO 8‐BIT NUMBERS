7.	DIVISION OF TWO 8‐BIT NUMBERS
AIM:

To perform division of two 8‐bit numbers using 8085.

ALGORITHM:

1)	Load divisor and move to register B.
2)	Load dividend into accumulator.
3)	Initialize register C (quotient) by zero.
4)	Compare dividend with divisor.
5)	Subtract register B (divisor)from accumulator.
6)	Increment register C.
7)	Repeat steps 4 through 6 until dividend is less than divisor.
8)	Store remainder (accumulator) and quotient (register C) into memory.
9)	Terminate the program.

PROGRAM:

Label	Mnemonics	Hex Code	Description
	MVI C, 00	0E 00	Initialize register C to 00
	LDA 1001	3A 1000	Load divisor to accumulator
	MOV B, A	47	Move content of accumulator to register B
	LDA 1000	3A 1001	Load dividend to accumulator
LOOP:	CMP B	B8	Compare accumulator and register B
	JC NEXT	DA NEXT	Jump on carry
	SUB B	90	Subtract register B from accumulator
	INR C	0C	Increment value of register C (quotient)
	JMP LOOP	C3 LOOP	Jump
NEXT:	STA 2000	32 2000	Store value of accumulator to memory
	MOV A, C	79	Move content of register C to accumulator
	STA 2001	32 2001	Store value of accumulator to memory
	HLT	76	Halt program

RESULT:	
Input:	1000: F0
1001: 15	(dividend) (divisor)
Output:	2000: 09
2001: 0B	(remainder) (quotient)
