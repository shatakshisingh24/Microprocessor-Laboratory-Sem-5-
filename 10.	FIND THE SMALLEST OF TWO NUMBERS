10.	FIND THE SMALLEST OF TWO NUMBERS
AIM:

To find the smallest between two given numbers using 8085.

ALGORITHM:

1)	Load first data into accumulator.
2)	Move the data to register B.
3)	Load the second data into accumulator.
4)	Compare both the numbers.
5)	If register value is smaller than accumulator, copy register into accumulator.
6)	Store the result into memory.
7)	Terminate the program.

PROGRAM:

Label	Mnemonics	Hex Code	Description
	LDA 1000	3A 1000	Load value to accumulator
	MOV B, A	47	Move content of accumulator to register B
	LDA 1001	3A 1001	Load value to accumulator
	CMP B	B8	Compare accumulator and register B
	JC NEXT	DA NEXT	Jump on carry
	MOV A, B	78	Move content of register B to accumulator
NEXT:	STA 2000	32 2000	Store value of accumulator to memory
	HLT	76	Halt program

RESULT:

Input:	1000: 45
1001: 15

Output:	2000: 15
